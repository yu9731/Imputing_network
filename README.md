# Imputing_network
Network for paper

#### This github repository is used to reproduce the results of the model reconstructed for missing values in heating load data with context encoder, including three parts:
#### load_data.py: Normalizing and Preprocessing the training data and model the training data and test data with sliding window
#### model.py: Modeling, compiling and training the context encoder and saving the trained model
#### test.py: Validating with test data

# Data

#### The data provided here for reproducing the results are from When2Heat Profiles and Ni≈° datasets. Due to the data protection requirements of Green Fusion GmbH in Berlin, we can only provide the electrical load data here to make the results of the TCN-BiLSTM-CE reproducible.
